## 🔨 Rules
### Payments

Payments are handled via PayPal invoices. Before I start working on your commission, we’ll discuss your idea and agree on a fair price for it. Afterwards I’ll send you an invoice. 

I won’t start working on your piece until the payment is made. However, payment isn't required until I get to your point in the queue. So if your slot takes a few weeks/months to get to, you don't have to worry about the payment until that point. It's up to you whether you pay immediately or wait until I get to your spot.

### Refunds
You can request a refund for your commission at any point during the process. The total refund amount depends on how much work I’ve put in so far. For example:
- Before the commission is started, you will get a full refund.
- If the commission is halfway done, you will get a 50% refund.
- Completed commissions are not refundable.


### Banned Topics
I will never accept commissions of the following topics:
- ❌ Illegal things {{< spoiler txt="(Underaged Characters, etc.)" >}}
- ❌ Depictions of real people, or their original characters, without their consent.


### Ownership
Once I’ve finished your commission, it’s yours to keep and do whatever you want with! Go crazy!
